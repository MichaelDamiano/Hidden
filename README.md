Hidden is a react web application I have been creating which aims to help people find cool places to visit. This is my first react project so I've been learning the framework as I go on.

modes:
Currently, there is only one mode to find attractions which is "explore" mode. Here, you can input the name of a state or country (a city is optional) to search for attractions in that area. The other mode that is planned is "navigate" mode. In this mode, you will be able to input a number of points onto the map, creating a route. This will search for any nearby attractions along the route.
